<h1>Sarah's Top 3 Movies</h1>
<h2>my favourite movies of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Trains, Planes and Automobiles</h3>
<p>
   A childhood favourite that I still quote many lines or scenes from now<br />
   Steve Martin and John Candy in a road trip comedy with a heart warming ending.
</p>

<h3>Wall-E</h3>
<p>
   An animated movie of a dystopian future where humans have destroyed the earth through over consumption and taken to a 
   giant cruise ship style spaceship that awaits the robotic clean up of earth. <br />
   The plot line is worryingly possible for our future and should be a stark wake up call to what we are doing to the 
   planet and our bodies.
</p>

<h3>Fern Gulley: The Last Rainforest</h3>
<p>
   Another amimated movie from my childhood with a deeper warning about human impact to the planet.
