<p>Hi, I'm Sarah and I am learning website design, initially as a hobby, but with the potential
   to change my career path. This is my portfolio website to showcase all I learn and create during my course
    and any future websites.</p>

<p>I live in West Yorkshire, England with my partner, his children two nights a week and our dog Jasper.
   I love to travel and this photo is me outside a rather damp cave room I was staying in on a hiking 
   trip in the Cinque Terre. </p>

<p>My other interests include all things yoga and wellness, baking, gardening, puzzles and crafting. I have taken a
   career break after 20 years in housebuilding to see if I can find something more fulfilling, hence
    the website design course following a Python coding course that didn't inspire me much. I love technology,
    sustainability and all kinds of adventures, so the dream is to find a way to bring these together
    and make a living from it.</p>
